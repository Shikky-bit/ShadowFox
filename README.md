# 🟢 Beginner Task — **Image Tagging Model**  
*(Beginner Level — Task 1)* 

### 📌 Problem Statement  
Develop a practical solution for **image tagging** by training a simple image classification model.  
The model should classify basic categories such as **cat, dog, car, etc.** using ML libraries such as **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.

The goal is to build an accessible, real-world-applicable classification system.

# 🔴 Advanced Task — **Language Model (LM) Deployment & Analysis**  
*(Advanced Level — Task 1)* 

### 📌 Problem Statement  
Deploy a **Language Model (LM)** of your choice (GPT-3, BERT, or any LM).  
Implement it inside a Jupyter notebook, analyze its performance, test contextual responses, evaluate text generation, and explore its capabilities in depth.

You must:
- Select an LM  
- Implement it from scratch  
- Test responses on different inputs  
- Analyze strengths, weaknesses, creativity, context handling  
- Provide visualizations & insights
